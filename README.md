## Purpose of the web application
Our team wants to create an online daily puzzle in this web application - N-Puzzle, that can help users improve their logical reasoning ability.
N-Puzzle is a sliding-block puzzle that is easy for everyone to get started. All ages could enjoy that game. The player can click the block and move it to the space block. When the numbers are in numerical order, the player wins the game. <br>

Here is the demo video to show how to play the eight-Puzzle:

 <br>
The team designs an eight-Puzzle game. The game will cost around 2-4 minutes. Users can play it during their break time or on the bus. After users complete their game, they can share their achievements to their social network and check their performance rank.

## The architecture of the web application
**Model View Controller**
<br>
<div align=center><img src="https://miro.medium.com/proxy/0*Qf1s2lG86MjX-Zcv.jpg" width="420" height="280" alt="MVC"/></div>
<br>
MVC was reportedly invented by Trygve Reenskaug in the 1970's and becomes one of the most popular patter for server side web applications.
<br>
<br>

**Model**
<br>
The model represents the data and logic of the app. It will be paired with an entity in a database.(e.g. User in this app)<br>
After receive the request from controller, model will pick up the required data back to controller.<br>

**Controller**
<br>
The controller is the go-between for models and views. It relays data from browser to app and from app to browser. <br>
In this project routes.py work as controller. <br>
When the users want to move to new page, they send the request to controller. And controller will render the view.<br>

**View**
<br>
The view is the only part of the app the user interacts with directly. It is attached to the model and in turn displays the modelâ€™s data.<br>
The html files in the templete folder work as view.<br>
Users can read information and intercat with it.<br>
