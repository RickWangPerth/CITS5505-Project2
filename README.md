## Purpose of the web application
Our team wants to create an online daily puzzle in this web application - N-Puzzle, that can help users improve their logical reasoning ability.
N-Puzzle is a sliding-block puzzle that is easy for everyone to get started. All ages could enjoy that game. The player can click the block and move it to the space block. When the numbers are in numerical order, the player wins the game.

Here is the demo video to show how to play the 8-Puzzle:

The team designs two models: an easy model (8-Puzzle) and a complex model (15-Puzzle). The game will cost around 2-6 minutes. Users can play it during their break time or on the bus. After users complete their game, they can share their achievements to their social network and check their performance rank.
